   <p>
    You probably loved Maths (or at least liked it a bit) at school, and did well at A-Levels to get here - good job! You'll probably expect to arrive to your first lecture thinking the same sort of thing will happen again and everything will fall into place - easy First Class degree in the bag. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Except a lot of the time it's not like that at all and you'll be sat there thinking "WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"
  </p>
  <p>
    Don't worry, this is normal. Uni maths is a step up, this is the challenging part.
  </p>
  <p>
    A basic algorithm for surviving the maths course:
    </br>
    1. Go to lectures <i>(or make friends with people who will go)</i><br>
    2. Re-read your lecture notes <i>(or catch up on them if you've missed the lec)</i><br>
    3. Go to tutorials & try the problem sheets <i>(even though some will be disgusting)</i><br>
    4. Hand in the problem sheets <i>(even if you've only written your name and copied the question out - tutors get paid to mark per script and will help you in tutorials)</i> <br>
    5. Revise & Take exams <i>(self explanatory haha)</i>

  <div class="panel-body">
    <p>Getting to uni can be a massive culture shock in itself regardless of what course you're studying, so with the added pressure of studying one of the hardest subjects out there, you might be stressing out a little bit.
  </p>
  <p>
  Weird housemates, mouldy bedroom, cooking, cleaning, doing the washing... (missing your mum is okay haha) The important thing to remember is everyone is in the same boat and you can't let boring household tasks ruin your time at uni - especially in first year - lighten up and have fun!
  </p>
<p><b>Practical tips:</b> Learn how to cook basic meals if you don't know already - works out cheaper and tastier in long run, keep your room/kitchen relatively clean & tidy, party as much as you want but make sure sleep also happens to avoid this:
